Problem Statement:

You are given the coordinates of two points in a 2D plane. The task is to calculate the Euclidean distance between these two points and print the result formatted to three decimal places.

 Input:
- The first line contains two integers, x1 and y1, representing the coordinates of the first point.
- The second line contains two integers, x2 and y2, representing the coordinates of the second point.

 Output:
- Output the Euclidean distance between the two points, formatted to three decimal places.

 Constraints:
- -1000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 1000

 Example:
Input:

1 2
4 6


Output:

5.000
