Question:

You are given three points in a 2D plane. Each point has an x and y coordinate. Your task is to determine which point has the greatest Euclidean distance from the origin (0, 0) and print its coordinates.

 Input Format:
- The input consists of six floating-point numbers:
  - The first two numbers represent the x and y coordinates of the first point (p1).
  - The next two numbers represent the x and y coordinates of the second point (p2).
  - The last two numbers represent the x and y coordinates of the third point (p3).

 Output Format:
- Print the x and y coordinates of the point that has the greatest distance from the origin.

 Euclidean Distance Formula:
The Euclidean distance d of a point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0) is calculated as:
d = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} 

 Constraints:
- All coordinate values are real numbers.
  
 Example:

 Input:

1.0 1.0
2.0 2.0
3.0 3.0


 Output:

3.0
3.0


 Explanation:
- The distance of point (1.0, 1.0) from the origin is approximately 1.414.
- The distance of point (2.0, 2.0) from the origin is approximately 2.828.
- The distance of point (3.0, 3.0) from the origin is approximately 4.242.

Since the third point (3.0, 3.0) is the farthest from the origin, its coordinates are printed.
