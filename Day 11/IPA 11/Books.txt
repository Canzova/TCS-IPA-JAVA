Question Statement:

Write a Java program to manage information about books using object-oriented programming principles. You are required to create a class Book with the following attributes and methods:

 Class: Book
- Attributes:
  - id (int): A unique identifier for each book.
  - title (String): The title of the book.
  - author (String): The author of the book.
  - price (double): The price of the book.
  
- Constructor: Create a parameterized constructor that initializes the id, title, author, and price of the book.

- Methods:
  - getId(): Returns the id of the book.
  - getTitle(): Returns the title of the book.
  - getAuthor(): Returns the author of the book.
  - getPrice(): Returns the price of the book.

You also need to write a method sortBooksByprice that accepts an array of Book objects and sorts them in ascending order based on their price using a lambda expression. The sorted array should be returned.

 Input:
- First, input details of 4 books (book ID, title, author, and price) in sequence.
- Each book's information is provided in the following order:
  - Book ID (integer)
  - Book title (string)
  - Book author (string)
  - Book price (double)

 Output:
- After sorting the books by their price in ascending order, output the details of the sorted books, including the ID, title, author, and price.

 Example:

Input:

101
The Alchemist
Paulo Coelho
499.99
102
1984
George Orwell
299.99
103
Harry Potter
J.K. Rowling
999.99
104
To Kill a Mockingbird
Harper Lee
399.99


Output:

102 1984 George Orwell 299.99
104 To Kill a Mockingbird Harper Lee 399.99
101 The Alchemist Paulo Coelho 499.99
103 Harry Potter J.K. Rowling 999.99


 Requirements:
- Use an array to store the Book objects.
- Utilize a lambda expression to define the custom sorting logic based on the price.
- Implement getter methods for each attribute in the Book class.
